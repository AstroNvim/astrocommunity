# copilot.lua + CMP

Fully featured & enhanced replacement for copilot.vim complete with API for interacting with Github Copilot

**Repository:** <https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua>

_Note_: This plugin will also reconfigure `cmp` in AstroNvim to make `<Tab>` work with both auto completion in `cmp` and `copilot`.
