# magazine.nvim

> [!NOTE]
> Magazine is a fork of `nvim-cmp`. The way this plugin is setup is to hijack into an existing `nvim-cmp` installation. So make sure that `nvim-cmp` is still installed and enabled for this plugin to work and all configuration is still done through `nvim-cmp` as normal.

Magazine.nvim is a "beta" nvim-cmp to fix bugs & implement new features early
