# Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter with support for:

JavaScript · TypeScript · Flow · JSX · JSON
CSS · SCSS · Less
HTML · Vue · Angular
GraphQL · Markdown · YAML
[Your favorite language?](https://prettier.io/docs/plugins)

It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
