# Rust Language Pack
this pack is not approved by the rust foundation
nobody from the rust foundation is involved to create this
this pack is not officially supported by the rust foundation
This plugin pack does the following:

- Adds `rust` Treesitter parsers
- Adds [rust-tools.nvim](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim) for language specific tooling
- Adds [crates.nvim](https://github.com/Saecki/crates.nvim) for crate management
- Adds [TOML language support](../toml)

> [!NOTE]
> This pack DOES not add `rust_analyzer`. This should be managed by rustup. To add it to rustup, run:  `rustup component add rust-analyzer`

## Additional LSP Configuration Tweaks

Configuring the LSP is out of scope for community packs, but here are some interesting things you
may want to do:

## Make Rust-Analyzer use its own profile

Add this into your LSP configuration to make the rust-analyzer use its own profile. The effect is
that you will use more disk space as rust-analyzer gets its own special folder in `targets`. The
upside is that you can run `cargo build` without that being blocked while rust-analyzer runs.

The first three levels of this are AstronVim-specific configurations, the rest is rust-analyzer specific:

```
  lsp = {
    config = {
      rust_analyzer = {
        settings = {
          ["rust-analyzer"] = {
           cargo = {
              extraEnv = { CARGO_PROFILE_RUST_ANALYZER_INHERITS = 'dev', },
              extraArgs = { "--profile", "rust-analyzer", },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
```

## Use clippy instead of cargo check

If you'd like to run cargo clippy instead of cargo check on safe, add the following:

```
  lsp = {
    config = {
      rust_analyzer = {
        settings = {
          -- Add clippy lints for Rust.
          ["rust-analyzer"] = {
            checkOnSave = {
              allFeatures = true,
              command = "clippy",
              extraArgs = { "--no-deps" },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
```
