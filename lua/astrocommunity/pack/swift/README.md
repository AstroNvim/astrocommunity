# Swift Language Pack

## Note: xbase is a WIP plugin, and the experience provided by this plugin might be lackluster

**Requirements:**

1. Make sure you have [sourcekit-lsp](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) installed on your machine.

2. Install Xcode Device Simulators:
   To enable simulator functionality from within Neovim, you need to have Xcode Device Simulators installed on your machine. You can install these simulators from Xcode.

3. Mappings:
   The default mappings for the xbase plugin overlap with AstroNvim's default. Therefore, you should set the mappings yourself.
   Refer to [xBase](https://github.com/kkharji/xbase#neovim-3) documentation for more options.

```lua
opts = {
  -- ... (other options)

  mappings = {
    enable = true,
    build_picker = "<leader>rb", -- Set to 0 to disable
    run_picker = "<leader>ra", -- Set to 0 to disable
    watch_picker = 0, -- Set to 0 to disable
    all_picker = 0, -- Set to 0 to disable
    toggle_split_log_buffer = 0,
    toggle_vsplit_log_buffer = "<leader>rs",
  },

  -- ... (other options)
}
```
