# ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool for identifying and reporting on
patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more
consistent and avoiding bugs.

ESLint is completely pluggable. Every single rule is a plugin and you can add
more at runtime. You can also add community plugins, configurations, and
parsers to extend the functionality of ESLint.

## Prerequisites

To use ESLint, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (^18.18.0, ^20.9.0, or >=21.1.0) installed
and built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)
