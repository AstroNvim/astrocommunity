# ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

## Prerequisites

To use ESLint, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS installed
and built with SSL support. (If you are using an official Node.js distribution, SSL is always built in.)
