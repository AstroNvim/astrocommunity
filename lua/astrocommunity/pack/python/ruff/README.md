# Python Ruff Pack

**Requirements:** `python` must be in your `PATH` and executable

This plugin pack does the following:

- Adds `ruff` language server for linting and formatting
- Configures `ruff_organize_imports` and `ruff_format` formatters

**Note:** This pack does not include Python syntax highlighting or debugging. Use [Python Pack](../) for that.
