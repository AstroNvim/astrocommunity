# nvim-neoclip

`neoclip` is a clipboard manager for neovim inspired by for example [`clipmenu`](https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu).
It records everything that gets yanked in your vim session (up to a limit which is by default 1000 entries but can be configured).
You can then select an entry in the history using [`telescope`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) or [`fzf-lua`](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) which then gets populated in a register of your choice.
