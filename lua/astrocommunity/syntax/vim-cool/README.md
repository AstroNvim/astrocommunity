# vim-cool

A very simple plugin that makes hlsearch more useful.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/romainl/vim-cool> 

Vim-cool disables search highlighting when you are done searching and re-enables it when you search again. That's it. No more `:noh<CR>`, no more `/sytdstdrsid<CR>`, and no more dodgy `<C-l>` mappings.
