Synchronize Vim, Tmux, and OS clipboards via OSC 52

**Repository:** <https://github.com/jabirali/vim-tmux-yank>

This is a simple plugin for synchronizing the clipboards of `vim`/`nvim`,
`tmux`, and a variety of operating systems, even over remote connections.
It does so via a terminal escape called OSC 52.
