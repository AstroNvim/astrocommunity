# harp.nvim

**Repositories:** 

Harp: https://github.com/Axlefublr/harp (**Required to use the plugin**)

**Repository:** <https://github.com/Thorinori/harp-nvim>




**Notes:**
1. Plugin still in progress some (trying to not introduce any breaking changes to keybinds)
2. Would currently recommend changing keybindings directly in the astrocommunity entry if you choose to
3. Should also work fine with lazy=true, picked false to be able to use harp functionality immediately
4. Default keybinds include rebinding m and ' in favor of using harp for their functions. These 2 binds can simply be disabled to return to normal mark functionality
