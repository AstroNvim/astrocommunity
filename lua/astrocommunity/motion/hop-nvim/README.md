Neovim motions on speed!

**Repository:** <https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim>

Hop is an EasyMotion-like plugin allowing you to jump anywhere in a document with as few keystrokes as possible. It does so by annotating text in your buffer with hints, short string sequences for which each character represents a key to type to jump to the annotated text. Most of the time, those sequencesâ€™ lengths will be between 1 to 3 characters, making every jump target in your document reachable in a few keystrokes.
