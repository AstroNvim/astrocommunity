## parpar-nvim

A plugin for Neovim that combines two alternative approaches for structural editing with Lisp dialects.

Parinfer ensures parenthesis are balanced based on indentation of each line of code.

Paredit provides commands (slurp, barf, raise, etc) to move code around whilst ensuring balanced parens.

Parpar integrates the two plugins to ensure they play well together.

Supported Languages: Clojure, Fennel, Scheme, CommonLisp
