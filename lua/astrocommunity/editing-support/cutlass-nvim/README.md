# cutlass.nvim

Plugin that adds a 'cut' operation separate from 'delete'

**Repository:** <https://github.com/gbprod/cutlass.nvim>

Cutlass overrides the delete operations to actually just delete and not affect the current yank.

This plugin also adds the `leap.nvim` integration if the plugin is present.
