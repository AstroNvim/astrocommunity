# nvim-ts-rainbow2

Rainbow delimiters for Neovim through Tree-sitter

**Repository:** <https://github.com/HiPhish/nvim-ts-rainbow2>

_Note_: This plugin has been deprecated in favor of the new [rainbow-delimiters.nvim](https://github.com/HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim)

This is a hard fork of the nvim-ts-rainbow package & is recommended over it.
