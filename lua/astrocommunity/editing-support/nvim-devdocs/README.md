nvim-devdocs is a plugin which brings [DevDocs][devdocs-site] documentations into neovim.
Install, search and preview documentations directly inside neovim in markdown format with telescope integration.
You can also use custom commands like [glow][glow-repo] to render the markdown for a better experience.

_Astrocommunity note: [glow][glow-repo] render will work out of the box if you have it on your PATH_

[devdocs-site]: https://devdocs.io/
