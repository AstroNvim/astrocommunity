# sniprun

A neovim plugin to run lines/blocs of code (independently of the rest of the file), supporting multiples languages

**Repository**: <https://github.com/michaelb/sniprun>

Sniprun is a code runner plugin for neovim written in Lua and Rust.
It aims to provide stupidly fast partial code testing for interpreted and compiled languages.
Sniprun blurs the line between standard save/run workflow, jupyter-like notebook, and REPL/interpreters.
