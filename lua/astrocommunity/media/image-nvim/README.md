# image.nvim

This plugin attempts to add image support to Neovim.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/3rd/image.nvim>

Works with Kitty + Tmux, and it handles painful things like rendering an image at a given position in a buffer, scrolling, windows, etc.

It has built-in Markdown and Neorg integrations that you can use right now.
It can also render image files as images when opened.

**Requirements**

These are things you have to setup on your own

- Kitty >= 28.0 - for the kitty backend
- ueberzugpp - for the ueberzug backend
- curl - for remote images

**This plugin is configured to be used with kitty terminal**
