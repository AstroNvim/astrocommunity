# persistent-breakpoints.nvim

Neovim plugin for persistent breakpoints.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/Weissle/persistent-breakpoints.nvim>

Persistent-breakpoints is a lua plugin for Neovim to save the nvim-dap's checkpoints to file and automatically load them when you open neovim.
It is based on the code in here, but has better performance and some bugs are fixed.
